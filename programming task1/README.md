Make use of the template from here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d0sd1TcJaJAqH8cCkdBVpsUoxHW0pyFm?usp=sharing to implement your own version of the algorithm to solve the finite-horizon problem in the frozen lake environment: https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/frozen_lake.py.

We will use T = 1000 and to evaluate your solution (cf. the T = 10 in the template for testing reasons).

Stick to the "FrozenLake8x8-v1" environment loaded in the template.

You must submit your solutions as a google colab link (make sure it gives an output in colab before you send it).

Use the instructions provided in the template to run it locally on your computer if you want a visual representation using pygame (optional).

Before submitting, make sure that you have enabled "Anyone on the internet with the link can view" under "Share" and rename your file as "mfrl'23-PT1-your_name.ipynb".

The output must be in following format:

output = [(state,action)]

# The game

Frozen lake involves crossing a frozen lake from Start(S) to Goal(G) without falling into any Holes(H)
by walking over the Frozen(F) lake.
The agent may not always move in the intended direction due to the slippery nature of the frozen lake.

    ### Action Space
    The agent takes a 1-element vector for actions.
    The action space is `(dir)`, where `dir` decides direction to move in which can be:

    - 0: LEFT
    - 1: DOWN
    - 2: RIGHT
    - 3: UP

    ### Observation Space
    The observation is a value representing the agent's current position as
    current_row * nrows + current_col (where both the row and col start at 0).
    For example, the goal position in the 4x4 map can be calculated as follows: 3 * 4 + 3 = 15.
    The number of possible observations is dependent on the size of the map.
    For example, the 4x4 map has 16 possible observations.

    ### Rewards

    Reward schedule:
    - Reach goal(G): +1
    - Reach hole(H): 0
    - Reach frozen(F): 0

    ### Arguments

    ```
    gym.make('FrozenLake-v1', desc=None, map_name="4x4", is_slippery=True)
    ```

    `desc`: Used to specify custom map for frozen lake. For example,

        desc=["SFFF", "FHFH", "FFFH", "HFFG"].

        A random generated map can be specified by calling the function `generate_random_map`. For example,

        ```
        from gym.envs.toy_text.frozen_lake import generate_random_map

        gym.make('FrozenLake-v1', desc=generate_random_map(size=8))
        ```

    `map_name`: ID to use any of the preloaded maps.

        "4x4":[
            "SFFF",
            "FHFH",
            "FFFH",
            "HFFG"
            ]

        "8x8": [
            "SFFFFFFF",
            "FFFFFFFF",
            "FFFHFFFF",
            "FFFFFHFF",
            "FFFHFFFF",
            "FHHFFFHF",
            "FHFFHFHF",
            "FFFHFFFG",
        ]

    `is_slippery`: True/False. If True will move in intended direction with
    probability of 1/3 else will move in either perpendicular direction with
    equal probability of 1/3 in both directions.

        For example, if action is left and is_slippery is True, then:
        - P(move left)=1/3
        - P(move up)=1/3
        - P(move down)=1/3
